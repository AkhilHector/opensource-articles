# experiments
These are some of the random experiments that I perform in areas ranging from machine learning, server side programming, neural networks, statistics etc. The results of most of these experiments might not be significant and in some cases the experiment in itself could just be a replication of an already concluded study. Irrespective of all that the idea behind having this repository is to ignore the result of the experiment and focus on the process.

# Data
Despite the nature of the experiments and the repository in itself being public the datasets used while performing the study are not public. Please note that there are no copyrights to the dataset. If you are interested in obtaining the dataset please mail me.
